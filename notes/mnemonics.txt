Tilde and Caret
- e.g. HEAD~, HEAD~~, HEAD~2, HEAD^, HEAD^^, HEAD^2
- ~ goes to your father (first parent)
- ~n goes back down the paternal line for n generations and always goes to the first parent if there is more than one parent
- a string of "~"s is decomposed into a string of "~1"s
- it follows that a string of n "~"s is the same as a string of n "~1"s and the same as "~n"
- ^ goes to your father (first parent)
- ^n goes to the nth sibling in your father's set of siblings (assuming your father is the first of his siblings)
- a string of "^"s is decomposed into a string of "^1"s
- it follows that a string of n "^"s is the same as a string of n "^1"s and thus NOT the same as "^n" (but it IS the same as "~n")
- instead, "^n" is one of your uncles while "~n" is one of your patrilineal line
- in this metaphor, your parents are the set of your father and all his brothers
